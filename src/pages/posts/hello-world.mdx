import Callout from '../../components/Callout.astro';

Welcome! This is a sample MDX post showing how components work inline with markdown.

## What this setup includes

- Markdown & MDX via `@astrojs/mdx`
- Syntax highlighting with Shiki (GitHub Dark theme)
- A `Post` layout with date and tags
- `Callout` and `PostCard` components

## Using the Callout component

<Callout type="tip">
  MDX lets you drop in Astro components anywhere in your content.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Heads up">
  Make sure any component you import in MDX is an Astro component or a framework component with the correct integration installed.
</Callout>

## Code example

```ts
const greeting = 'hello world';
```

Add new `.md` or `.mdx` files to `src/pages/posts/` to create new posts.
